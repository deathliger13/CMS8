            <h4>1 Introduction</h4>
            <p class="introduction_one">People have always copied things. In 
            the past, most items of value were physical objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Patent law and economies of scale meant that small scale copying 
            of physical objects was usually uneconomic, and large-scale 
            copying (if it infringed) was stoppable using policemen and courts.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Today, things of value are increasingly less tangible: 
            often they are just bits and bytes or can be accurately represented 
            as bits and bytes.</p>
            <p class="introduction_two">The widespread deployment of packet-
            switched networks and the huge advances in computers and codec-
            technologies has made it feasible (and indeed attractive) to 
            deliver such digital works over the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
            presents great opportunities and great challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
            opportunity is low-cost delivery of personalized, desirable high-
            quality content.  The challenge is that such content can be 
            distributed illegally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright law governs the 
            legality of copying and distribution of such valuable data, but 
            copyright protection is increasingly strained in a world of 
            programmable computers and high-speed networks.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction_three">For example, consider the staggering 
            burst of creativity by authors of computer programs that are 
            designed to share audio files.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was first 
            popularized by Napster, but today several popular applications and 
            services offer similar capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-writers have 
            become mainstream, and DVD-writers may well follow suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Hence, even in the absence of network connectivity, the opportunity 
            for low-cost, large-scale file sharing exists.

            <h4>2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Darknet</h4>
            <p class="darknet_one">Throughout this paper, we will call the 
            shared items (e.g. software programs, songs, movies, books, etc.) 
            objects<span>. The persons who copy objects</span> will be called 
            users of the darknet, and the computers used to share objects will 
            be called hosts
            </p>
            <p class="darknet_two">The darknet is the distribution network 
            that emerges from the injection of objects according to assumption 
            1 and the distribution of <span>those objects according to 
            assumptions 2 and 3.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="darknet_three">One implication of the first assumption 
            is that any content protection system will leak popular or 
            interesting content into the darknet, because some fraction of 
            users--possibly experts–will overcome any copy prevention 
            mechanism or because the object will enter the darknet before 
            copy protection occurs. 
            </p>
            <p class="darknet_four"><span class="bold">The term “widely 
            distributed”</span> is intended to capture the notion of mass 
            market distribution of objects to thousands or millions of 
            practically anonymous users. <span class="italic">This is in 
            contrast to the protection of military,</span> industrial, or 
            personal secrets, which are typically not widely distributed and 
            are not the focus of this paper.

            <h5>2.1 Central Internet Servers</h5>
            <p class="cis_one">By 1998, a new form of the darknet began to 
            emerge from technological advances in several areas. The internet 
            had become mainstream, and as such its protocols and infrastructure
             could now be relied upon by anyone seeking to connect users with a
             centralized service or with each other. The continuing fall in the
             price of storage together with advances in compression technology 
            had also crossed the threshold at which storing large numbers of 
            audio files was no longer an obstacle to mainstream users. 
            Additionally, the power of computers had crossed the point at which
             they could be used as rendering devices for multimedia content. 
             Finally, “CD ripping” became a trivial method for content injection.

            <p class="cis_two">The first embodiments of this new darknet were 
            central internet servers with large collections of MP3 audio files.
             A fundamental change that came with these servers was the use of 
             a new distribution network: The internet displaced the sneaker net
             – at least for audio content. This solved several problems of the 
             old darknet.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, latency was reduced drastically.
            </p>
            <p class="cis_three">Secondly, and more importantly, discovery of 
            objects became much easier because of simple and powerful search 
            mechanisms – most importantly the general-purpose world-wide-web 
            search engine. The local view of the small world was replaced by a 
            global view of the entire collection accessible by all users. The 
            main characteristic of this form of the darknet was centralized 
            storage and search – a simple architecture that mirrored mainstream 
            internet servers.

            <h5>2.2 Central Internet Servers</h5>
            <p class="second_cis_one">Centralized or quasi-centralized 
            distribution and service networks make sense for legal online 
            commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bandwidth and infrastructure costs tend to be 
            low, and having customers visit a commerce site means the merchant 
            can display adverts, collect profiles, and bill efficiently.&nbsp;
            &nbsp;Additionally, management, auditing, and accountability are 
            much easier in a centralized model.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <picture>
                <img src="img/opossum.png" alt="opossum" class="opossum">
            </picture>
            <p></p>
            <p class="second_cis_two">However, centralized schemes work poorly 
            for illegal object distribution because large, central servers are 
            large single points of failure: If the distributor is breaking the 
            law, it is relatively easy to force him to stop.  Early MP3 Web 
            and FTP sites were commonly &quot;hosted&quot; by universities, 
            corporations, and ISPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright-holders or their 
            representatives sent &quot;cease and desist&quot; letters to these 
            web-site operators and web-owners citing copyright infringement 
            and in a few cases followed up with legal action &#91;15&#93;.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The threats of legal action were successful attacks on 
            those centralized networks, and MP3 web and FTP sites disappeared 
            from the mainstream shortly after they appeared.
