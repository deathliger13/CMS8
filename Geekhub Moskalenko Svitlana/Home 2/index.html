		<h1>The Darknet and the Future of Content Distribution</h1>

		<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
			<p><b>People have always copied things. In the past, most items of value were physical objects.<br>
				Patent law and economies of scale meant that small scale copying of physical objects was<br>
				usually uneconomic, and large-scale copying (if it infringed) was stoppable using policemen<br>
				and courts.  Today, things of value are increasingly less tangible: often they are just bits<br>
				and bytes or can be accurately represented as bits and bytes.</b></p>

			<p>The widespread deployment of packet-switched networks and the huge advances in computers and<br>
			codec-technologies has made it feasible (and indeed attractive) to deliver such digital works over<br>
			the Internet.  This presents great opportunities and great challenges.  The opportunity is low-cost<br>
			delivery of personalized, desirable high-quality content.  The challenge is that such content can be<br>
			distributed illegally.  Copyright law governs the legality of copying and distribution of such<br>
			valuable data, but copyright protection is increasingly strained in a world of programmable<br>
			computers and high-speed networks.</p>

					<em>
					For example, consider the staggering burst of creativity by authors of computer programs that are<br>
					designed to share audio files.  This was 	first popularized by Napster, but today several popular<br>
					applications and services offer similar capabilities.  CD-writers have become 	mainstream, and DVD-writers<br>
					may well follow suit.  Hence, even in the absence of network connectivity, the opportunity for low-cost,<br>
					large-scale file sharing exists.

		<h2>2  The Darknet</h2>
			<p>Throughout this paper, we will call the shared items (e.g. software programs, songs, movies, books, etc.) objects.<br>
				<u>The persons who copy objects</u>will be called users of the darknet, and the computers used to share objects<br>
				will be called hosts.</p>

				<p>The darknet is the distribution network that emerges from the injection of objects according to assumption 1 and the<br>
					distribution of<b>those objects according to assumptions 2 and 3.</b></p>
					
					<p>One implication of the first assumption is that any content protection system will leak popular or interesting<br>
					content into the darknet, because some fraction of users--possibly experts–will overcome any copy prevention<br>
					mechanism or because the object will enter the darknet before copy protection occurs.</p>

					<p><b>The term “widely distributed”</b>is intended to capture the notion of mass market distribution of objects to<br>
					thousands or millions of practically anonymous users.<u>This is in contrast to the protection of military</u>, industrial,<br>
					or personal secrets, which are typically not widely distributed and are not the focus of this paper.</p>
		<h3>2.1 Central Internet Servers</h3>
					<p>
						By 1998, a new form of the darknet began to emerge from technological advances in several areas.<br>
						The internet hadbecome mainstream, and as such its protocols and infrastructure could now be relied<br>
						upon by anyone seeking to connect users with a centralizedservice or with each other. The continuing<br>
						fall in the price of storage together with advances in compression technology had also crossed the<br>
						threshold at which storing large numbers of audio files was no longer an obstacle to mainstream users.<br>
						Additionally, the power of computers had crossed the point at which they could be used as rendering<br>
						devices for multimedia content. Finally, “CD ripping” became a trivial method for content injection.

			<p><em><b>The first embodiments of this new darknet were central internet servers with large collections<br>
			of MP3 audio files. A fundamental change that came with these servers was the use of a new<br>
			distribution network: The internet displaced the sneaker net – at least for<br>
		    audio content. This solved several problems of the old darknet.  First, latency<br>
			was reduced drastically.</b></em></p>
		  
				<p>
					Secondly, and more importantly, discovery of objects became much easier because<br>
					of simple and powerful search mechanisms – most importantly the general-purpose world-wide-web<br>
					search engine. The local view of the small world was replaced by a global<br>
					view of the entire collection accessible by all users. The main characteristic<br>
					of this form of the darknet was centralized storage and search – a simple architecture<br>
					that mirrored mainstream internet servers.

			<h3>2.2 Central Internet Servers</h3>
				<p align="right"><em>Centralized or quasi-centralized distribution and service networks make sense for legal online<br>
				commerce.  Bandwidth and infrastructure costs tend to be low, and having customers visit a commerce<br>
				site means the merchant can display adverts, collect profiles, and bill efficiently.  Additionally,<br>
				management, auditing, and accountability are much easier in a centralized model.</em></right></p>

				 <p class="fit"><img src="img1.jpg" width="500" height="290" alt="Мышка"></p>
				 <p>However, centralized schemes work poorly for illegal object distribution because large, central servers<br>
				 are large single points of failure: If the distributor is breaking the law, it is relatively easy to force him<br>
				to stop.  Early MP3 Web and FTP sites were commonly “hosted” by universities, corporations, and ISPs. <br>
			    Copyright-holders or their representatives sent “cease and desist” letters to these web-site operators and<br>
			    web-owners citing copyright infringement and in a few cases followed up with legal action [15].  The threats of<br>
			    legal action were successful attacks on those centralized networks, and MP3 web and FTP sites disappeared from the<br>
			    mainstream shortly after they appeared.</p>
